# Project Vision

The Store Management System is designed to simulate and manage the core operations of a small store or mini-market during a business period.

The main purpose of the system is to help understand and control how product costs, pricing strategies, suppliers, and customers interact over time, while preventing financial losses through automated price calculation and business rules.

This project focuses on backend logic and decision-making rather than user interface complexity, aiming to reflect real-world business scenarios in a simplified but realistic way.
